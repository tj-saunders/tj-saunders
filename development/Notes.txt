Everything is displayed in canvas, there are three different types of animation for sun, rain and clouds.
It searches for "rain" or "cloud" in the string to display those if it finds either in the description string.

Some of the tasks I'm not sure how to do, so I left them out ie. The node server and the testing procedure.
I also wasn't sure what "manually configuring the tooling for the project" or "you need to contain routing in the app" meant.

It took a lot longer than the hour specified, 3-4 hours with testing on different devices and fixes, I am very impressed people can do all this in one hour.

I realise this is not modular, I reused some classes from another project such as button which weren't modular.

Some classes may need more cleanup when destroyed, I didn't have time to check everything.

More checks could be done on data, such as checking for no response from server etc.

It's not responsive to rotation, this is a lot of work to redraw canvas elements, 
but it is placed centrally, some elements are dynamic depending on screen size and should fit most devices if you don't rotate.

I'd normally make a deploy version using Gulp, but have left it as the source files for now.
